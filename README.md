# Orb Gazer-VR
Orb Gazer (previously named "Puzzler-VR") is mobile VR game which challenges the player's memory through interesting "Simon" style puzzle. You can read my story and see my approach on how I built this game [here](https://medium.com/@srinivassai/puzzler-vr-c4481b12bd02).

## How to Build

* Clone this repository.
* Open Orb-Gazer in Unity.
* Download the [Google VR SDK for Unity version 1.7.0](https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/releases). Please note that there are some changes between different versions of the google sdk and the other versions may not necessarily work with this version of the game.
* Unzip the GVR SDK archive and import GoogleVRForUnity.unitypackage in Unity.
* Install iTween from the Unity Asset Store.
* Go to build settings and change the target to Android/IOS.
* Build the application and save the apk or ipa file.
* Install the file on your device and enjoy the VR experience.
